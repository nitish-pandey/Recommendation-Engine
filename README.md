# Recommendation-Engine
Recommendation engine  is the algorithmic technique to suggest the relevent items to the end-user.
Multiple methods and techniques are used in it.

>Project status : Active and Version : 1.00

## Problem Statement:
We consume a lot of content over the internet. And we all have different field of interest. Mainer times we get to see irrelevant content which we dont like over it, including ads.  
Recommendation System solves that problem bringing the smart method to show you the things you prefer and even the items you may like .



## Skills Required

   * Programming Language - Python 

   * Machine Learning 

   * Statistics and Computational Maths
   
   * Data Handling and Cleaning

   * Predictive modeling

   * etc.


## Technologies used

This project is created using [**python**](https://www.python.org/) and other libraries like :  
[![My Skills](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=py&theme=dark)](https://github.com/nitish-pandey/movie-Recommendation-system)

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Sklearn/Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#)
* etc.

The other libraries are enlisted in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## Challenges
  * Cold Start
  * Time and Space Complexity
  * Limitation of the Metrics

## Methods Used
  * **1. Simple Traditional Recommendation techniques**  
  * **2. Content Based Filtering**  
  * **3. Collaborative Filtering ( CF )**  
  
        a. Memory Based CF  
          i. user-to-user filtering 
          ii. item-to-item filtering
        
        b. Model Based CF  
          i. Matrix Factorization  
          ii. Associative Rule Method  
  * **4. Hybrid Filtering**

## Setup

 
To run this project , install [**python**](https://www.python.org/) locally and install the requirements using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) -

```terminal
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```

else you can use the [google colab notebook](Spam_Classifier.ipynb) for running the code online without installing any libraries , packages and dependencies.


## Dataset


The dataset used in this project is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv)
About Dataset
Context
These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.

This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

### Content

This dataset consists of the following files:

**movies_metadata.csv**:  
The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.

**keywords.csv**:   
Contains the movie plot keywords for our MovieLens movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.

**credits.csv**:   
Consists of Cast and Crew Information for all our movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.

**links.csv**:  
The file that contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of all the movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset.

**links_small.csv**:  
Contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of a small subset of 9,000 movies of the Full Dataset.

**ratings_small.csv**:  
The subset of 100,000 ratings from 700 users on 9,000 movies.

The Full MovieLens Dataset consisting of 26 million ratings and 750,000 tag applications from 270,000 users on all the 45,000 movies in this dataset can be accessed here
